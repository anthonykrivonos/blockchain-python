# Blockchain - Python

Straightforward and concurrent blockchain implementation in Python 3.

## What's inside?

This project consists of a server script (`server.py`), client code (`client.py`), data models for `block`s and and the `blockchain`, as well as both a client thread (`models/clientthread.py`) and a broadcast thread (`models/broadcastthread.py`).

### Installing and Running

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the project.
2. Start the server with `python server.py`.
3. Open a new tab in the terminal, and make sure the project is still the root.
3. Start the client with `python client.py`.
4. In the same tab as the client, input commands as follows:

```
-f ### -t ### -a ###
